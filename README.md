Over the years, I've created dozens of useful Unity tools and utilities that I have generalized for use, time and time again.  

I found myself copying over the same chunks of code to each project, so I figured I might as well package the code and share it, just in case anyone finds any use in it!

This package is still very much a work and progress and will grow as I develop/organize more.

**NOTE: PieTility requires the latest version of [MyBox](https://github.com/Deadcows/MyBox) to make for the best user experience**
